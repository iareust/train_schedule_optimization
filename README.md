# Cleaned Code Repository of the Bachelor Thesis "
Code Repository for the Bachelor Thesis on "Train Schedule Optimization with focus on Robustness"

The src Folder contains all relevant components. It is structured in the following 6 submodules
- experiments: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the genetic algorithms as well as the experiment setups and results
- gym-train-env: A gym environment which was used to test reinfocement learning agent. But because the optimization method was changed to genetic optimization, those environments were not finished. They can be used as a basis for a future project involving RL Agents.
- log_viewer: The Jupyter Notebook of the Log viewer which was used to present the random number experiment in the intermediat presentation.
- model: The implementation of the components which were described in the documentation.
- simulation: Implementation of the behaviour for the components decribed in the model
